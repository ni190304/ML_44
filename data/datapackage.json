GermanCentral Research EstablishmentHome Office Forensic Science ServiceAldermaston, Reading, Berkshire RG7 4PN\nDonor: \nVina Spiehler, Ph.D., DABFTDiagnostic Products Corporation(213) 776-0180 (ext 3014)\n# Data Set Information:\nVina conducted a comparison test of her rule-based system, BEAGLE, the nearest-neighbor algorithm, and discriminant analysis. BEAGLE is a product available through VRS Consulting, Inc.; 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 206; Marina Del Ray, CA 90292 (213) 827-7890 and FAX: -3189. In determining whether the glass was a type of \"float\" glass or not, the following results were obtained (# incorrect answers):\nType of Sample * Beagle * NN * DAWindows that were float processed (87) * 10 * 12 * 21Windows that were not:      (76) * 19 * 16 * 22\nThe study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence...if it is correctly identified!\n# Attribute Information:\n1. Id number: 1 to 2142. RI: refractive index3. Na: Sodium (unit measurement: weight percent in corresponding oxide, as are attributes 4-10)4. Mg: Magnesium5. Al: Aluminum6. Si: Silicon7. K: Potassium8. Ca: Calcium9. Ba: Barium10. Fe: Iron11. Type of glass: (class attribute)   * 1 building_windows_float_processed   * 2 building_windows_non_float_processed   * 3 vehicle_windows_float_processed   * 4 vehicle_windows_non_float_processed (none in this database)   * 5 containers   * 6 tableware   * 7 headlamps\n# Relevant Papers:\nIan W.
